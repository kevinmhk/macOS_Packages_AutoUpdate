# Feature Specification: macOS Packages AutoUpdate

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-2-scripts`  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build 2 scripts. 1st script is for keeping macOS packages up to date by running `brew update && brew upgrade` and `npm update -g`; 2nd script will install the 1st script to a `.plist` file and also use the `launchctl` command to load the `.plist` file"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a macOS user, I want to automatically keep my Homebrew and global npm packages up to date without manual intervention, so that my system software is always current.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the update script is created, **When** it is run, **Then** `brew update && brew upgrade` and `npm update -g` are executed.
2. **Given** the installation script is created, **When** it is run, **Then** a `.plist` file for the update script is created and loaded with `launchctl`.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Homebrew or npm is not installed?
- How does the system handle errors during the update process?
- What happens if the `.plist` file already exists?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a script to update Homebrew and global npm packages.
- **FR-002**: The update script MUST execute `brew update && brew upgrade`.
- **FR-003**: The update script MUST execute `npm update -g`.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a script to install the update script as a background service.
- **FR-005**: The installation script MUST create a `.plist` file.
- **FR-006**: The installation script MUST use `launchctl` to load the `.plist` file.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST handle cases where Homebrew or npm is not installed. If Homebrew or npm is not installed, the script should skip the respective update.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST log the update process to `~/macOSPackagesAutoUpdate.log` with a log level of `INFO`.
