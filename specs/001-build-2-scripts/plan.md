# Implementation Plan: macOS Packages AutoUpdate

**Branch**: `001-build-2-scripts` | **Date**: 2025-09-12 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-2-scripts/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The feature is to create two scripts. The first script will update macOS packages using `brew` and `npm`. The second script will install the first script as a background service using `launchd`.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: `bash`
**Primary Dependencies**: `brew`, `npm`, `launchctl`
**Storage**: `N/A`
**Testing**: `bats-core`
**Target Platform**: `macOS`
**Project Type**: `single project`
**Performance Goals**: `N/A`
**Constraints**: `N/A`
**Scale/Scope**: `N/A`

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (scripts)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? N/A
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a script-based feature.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? N/A
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? N/A
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes, logging to a file.
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

### Source Code (repository root)
```
# Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)

└── unit/
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research `bats-core` for shell script testing.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research bats-core for shell script testing on macOS"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use `bats-core` for testing.
   - Rationale: It is a simple and effective testing framework for shell scripts.
   - Alternatives considered: None.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - N/A

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - N/A

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - N/A

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Create `quickstart.md` with instructions on how to use the scripts.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - N/A

**Output**: quickstart.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create tasks for:
  - Setting up `bats-core`.
  - Writing unit tests for the update script.
  - Writing the update script.
  - Writing unit tests for the installation script.
  - Writing the installation script.
  - Creating the `quickstart.md` documentation.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.

**Estimated Output**: 6-8 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |
